# Support Vector Machine (SVM) in C#

The code has been adapted from Java code written in as part of my 2005 Bachelor's thesis
in Computer Science.
This repository only contains the core SVM functionality and a couple of **very** basic tests.

The Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) implementation is based on the pseudo code found [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tr-98-14.pdf).
